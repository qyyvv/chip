 Discord application created to conveniently retrieve and predict stock prices.

 The default bot prefix is `$`. To see a list of commands, use `$help`.
 
 Regarding installation, there is no special set-up, but the string `'<token>'` found in the `__constants__.py` file should be replaced with the Discord bot token you want to use.

 For issues regarding backwards compatibility of `discord.py`, refer to the official Discord API [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/version_guarantees.html#version-guarantees).
